# HoverBoard


## _Hoverboard Development Project_


## Introduction

-  Hoverboard is a web-based project. The hoverboard project has a cool effect painting on a box by hovering over it. It is coded in HTML5, JavaScript and CSS3.

-  In this project, we create a big square board with lots of tiny square boxes on it. We are going to colour those small square boxes by hovering over them. It has a simple background big box in the middle. The user has to hover the mouse over the box and it will display a random color. It has a very cool user interface that is easy to interact with. Also easy to sue without difficulty. JavaScript makes it more functional. It is a beginner-level project. Download and get experienced by yourself. Have a look at the screenshot below.
